# Auctioneer

This online auctioneer is a place to sell your old objects with a good price.
The items are sold at online auction with limited auction time which is determined by the seller.
You can find interesting items for your home or collection for less than what it costs to buy a new one. And the value lasts the day you want to sell. 

You can find a live demo [here](https://auction-meghdad.herokuapp.com/)
 
## UX
Auctioneer website is designed for general users or collectors who want to sell or buy old stuff.
 
The application is also pushed to my GitHub repository `https://github.com/meghdadyazdi/Auction` which can be cloned.

In this auctioneer the seller can start the auction after determining the auction duration. After that sellers start bidding until the time of auction is over.

The winner who offers the highest price should pay and the object will be shipped to his/her address.
